# Comparative-egg-clutch-biomechanics

This repository contains raw data, recordings, scripts, and code associated with the manuscript entitled "Egg-clutch biomechanics affect escape-hatching behavior and performance" submitted to Integrative Organismal Biology.

The full citation for the manuscript will be included here upon publication.

The 'Comparative egg clutch biomechanics and its effect on escape hatching in phyllomedusid treefrogs.Rmd' file contains the data processing and statistical analyses using the data found in the 'Comparative Egg Clutch Biomechanics.xlsx' file. Analyses are shown in chronological order as reported in the manuscript. We show details on importing, manipulating, summarizing, analyzing (testing hypotheses), and visualizing the data. See the manuscript for details on background, research questions, hypothesis, methods, etc...

The 'MATLAB code & Vibration recordings' folder contains the script and raw vibration recording files necessary to estimate values of free vibration frequencies and rates of vibration decay in the time domain, as described in the manuscript.
